Variables can also represent HTML elements. You can create a variable to store your copying the following code in place of the `...` on your page:

```javascript
document.getElementById('sound1')
```

The complete line should now say:

```javascript
var sound1btn = document.getElementById('sound1');
```

This code uses a *function* called `getElementById`. You'll learn about functions in the next section.
