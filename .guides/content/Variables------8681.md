You may have seen variables in math. In JavaScript, variables can represent almost anything -- words, money, even HTML elements. We use variables to hold information that we want to use later.

Whenever you're making a new variable you use the `var` keyword. After that, you put the name of the variables. To tell the computer what the variable represents, you use an equals sign (`=`). Here are some examples of variables:

```javascript
var name = 'Mjumbe';
var age = 32;
var website = 'http://about.mjumbepoe.com/';
var brothers = ['Jumatatu', 'Ambata', 'Watufani'];
var sisters = ['Tayarisha'];
```

## Types

Variables can represent different types of *objects*. Some of the values that the variables represent in the example above have quotes (`'`) around them. Those variables are called *strings*.
