We made a music box, and we want you to make one too!

Open up http://codedbykids.github.io/cbk-beat-machine/ to see our version of the music box. We like this one, but you can make yours however you want -- choose the [sounds](sounds.md) you want and style the animations like you want. Even add in animated images.

Think for a moment about what you want your music box to look and sound like.
