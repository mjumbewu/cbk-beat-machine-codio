In your HTML, make a variable called `sound1` that represents a *string* with the location of the sound you chose earlier (for example, *http://patatap.com/assets/A/piston-1.mp3*). If you chose more than one sound, you can make more variables for each one. Each variable should have its own name though (for example you could use `sound2`, `sound3`, ...)

Remember to use quotes (`'`) around your string value.
